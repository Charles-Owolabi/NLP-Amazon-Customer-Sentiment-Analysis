# Amazon Echo Customer Sentiment Analysis

In this project, we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict customer sentiment from real Amazon Echo customer reviews.

## Overview

-   AI/ML-based sentiment analysis is crucial for companies to automatically predict whether their customers are happy or not.
-   The process can be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of customer reviews.

## Sentiment Analysis Workflow

### Amazon Review

**Example Reviews:**

-   Positive Review: _"Love my Echo!"_
-   Negative Review: _"Sad joke. Worthless."_

### Sentiment Labels

-   **Positive Sentiment (Label = 1)**
-   **Negative Sentiment (Label = 0)**

## Sentiment Analysis Process

The sentiment analysis model will process the reviews and classify them as either positive or negative based on the content.
